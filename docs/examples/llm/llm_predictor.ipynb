When she arrived at the forest, her eyes widened in amazement. The trees were so tall and the air was fresh and clean. She spent the day exploring the different paths and discovering new sights.\n",

The woman invited Sarah inside and told her the story of how she had been living in the cottage for many years. She had been alone and without family or friends, and was happy to finally have someone to talk to. \n",
