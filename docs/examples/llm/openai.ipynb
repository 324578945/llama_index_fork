      "crimson and orange as the sun sets over the quiet town. The streets are empty except for a lone figure walking towards the old mansion at the edge of town. The figure is small and slender, dressed in all black with a hood covering their face. They move quickly, as if they are in a hurry to reach their destination. As they get closer to the mansion, they slow down and look around cautiously, ensuring that no one is watching. They climb over the fence surrounding the property and make their way towards the front door. With shaking hands, they pull out a key and quietly unlock the door. The door creaks as it slowly opens, revealing a dark and eerie interior. The figure hesitates for a moment before stepping inside. The air is frigid, but the figure continues onwards, passing through the grand hallway and up the grand staircase. They reach the top of the stairs and turn into a dimly lit room. On the far end of the room sits an old wooden chest. The figure approaches the chest, pulls out a key, and opens it. Inside, a set of ancient scrolls lie, waiting to be discovered. The figure looks at the scrolls intently, knowing that these documents hold the key to unlocking a great mystery. With a sense of excitement and nervousness, the figure carefully takes the scrolls and tucks them into their bag. They close the chest and turn to leave the room, but freeze as they hear a sound. Someone is coming...\n"

The man she has been avoiding for weeks.\n",

But for now, all she can do is keep moving forward, one step at a time, and hope that someday she will find the strength to love and be loved again."
